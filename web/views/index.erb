    Welcome to elevatoralerts.com!
  </p>

  <p>
    Click the sign in button above to sign in or create an account; once you've
done that, you can select the stations you want to receive emailed elevator
alerts for.  (We may also email you occasionally about new features.)
Currently, we only support <a href="https://www.bart.gov">BART</a>;
<a href="https://www.sfmta.com/">SF Muni</a> may be added in the future.
  </p>

  <h3>Why?</h3>
  <p>
    BART has an <a href="https://www.bart.gov/news/alerts">email and text subscription system</a> for elevator outages - but if you
sign up, you get outage alerts for every elevator in the system.  You probably
only want alerts for some stations.
  </p>

  <h3> Planned features</h3>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Text alerts</li>
      <li>Visualization of outage history</li>
      <li>Vacation mode ("don't send me elevator alerts between these dates")</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
