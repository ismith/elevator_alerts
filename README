Setup should be done via the console script, either by hand or scripted.

Periodically, you may wish to check for any newly-discovered Elevator records.
(That is, elevators reported by the API, but which have not been associated with
a station.)  To do this, run `Models::Elevator.stationless` from within the
console.

To get a local copy of heroku config:
```
heroku config -s >> .env
```

Heroku addons:
heroku addons:create heroku-postgres:hobby-dev # 7k records
heroku addons:create sendgrid:starter # 400/day

Note:
Not using heroku scheduler because it can only run hourly or every 10 minutes,
and I'm aiming for ~1/minute.

Possible future TODOs:
[ ] Add unsubscribe link - Sendgrid makes this really simple, but I'm not sure
  if there's a way to re-subscribe

HOWTO:
- log to stdout instead of sending email: set NO_EMAIL env var
